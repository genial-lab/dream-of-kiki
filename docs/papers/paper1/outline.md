**Target journal** : Nature Human Behaviour (primary)
**Format** : 8-10 pages main + 30-50 pages supplementary
**Word target** : ~5000 words main + supp unbounded

## 1. Abstract (250 words)

→ `abstract.md`

Structure :
- Sentence 1 : context / open problem (catastrophic forgetting,
  consolidation gap in AI)
- Sentence 2 : contribution claim (formal framework with executable
  axioms DR-0..DR-4 + Conformance Criterion)
- Sentence 3 : pipeline-validation summary (synthetic
  placeholder ablation, statistical pipeline end-to-end ;
  empirical numbers reported in Paper 2)
- Sentence 4 : significance (substrate-agnostic, open-science
  reproducible, OSF pre-registered)
- 1-2 sentences : key result + future work pointer (E SNN cycle 2)

---

## 2. Introduction (~1.5 pages)

→ `introduction.md`

Subsections :
- 2.1 Catastrophic forgetting and the consolidation gap in AI
- 2.2 Sleep-inspired consolidation : prior art (van de Ven 2020,
  Kirkpatrick 2017 EWC, Tononi SHY, Friston FEP, Hobson/Solms)
- 2.3 The four pillars (A consolidation, B homeostasis, C creative,
  D predictive) and why a unified formal framework is missing
- 2.4 Contribution roadmap : framework C-v0.5.0+STABLE with
  executable axioms + Conformance Criterion ; reference
  implementation reported in Paper 2

---

## 3. Background — four theoretical pillars

Subsections :
- 3.1 Pillar A : Walker/Stickgold consolidation
- 3.2 Pillar B : Tononi SHY synaptic homeostasis
- 3.3 Pillar C : Hobson/Solms creative dreaming
- 3.4 Pillar D : Friston Free Energy Principle
- 3.5 The compositional gap : why piecewise integration fails

---

## 4. Framework C-v0.5.0+STABLE

Subsections :
- 4.1 Primitives : 8 typed Protocols (α, β, γ, δ, 1-4 channels).
  Each operation must enumerate its **guard reference**
  (replay → S1, downscale → S2, restructure → S3, recombine → I3
  WARN) and bind to a conformance test under
  `tests/conformance/`. Rule : **don't add an operation without
  an accompanying guard reference and a conformance test.**
- 4.2 Profiles : P_min, P_equ, P_max with chain inclusion DR-4
- 4.3 Dream-episode 5-tuple ontology
- 4.4 Operations : replay, downscale, restructure, recombine
- 4.5 Axioms DR-0..DR-4
  - 4.5.1 DR-0 Accountability
  - 4.5.2 DR-1 Episodic conservation
  - 4.5.3 DR-2 Compositionality (free semigroup) — proof
    deferred (see `docs/proofs/dr2-compositionality.md` draft)
  - 4.5.4 DR-3 Substrate-agnosticism + Conformance Criterion
  - 4.5.5 DR-4 Profile chain inclusion
- 4.6 Invariants I/S/K with enforcement matrix
- 4.7 DualVer formal+empirical versioning
  (current : C-v0.5.0+STABLE per CHANGELOG.md)

---

## 5. Conformance Criterion validation approach

Substrate-agnostic. Substrate-specific implementation details
(MLX, runtime, ablation pipeline) live in Paper 2.

Subsections :
- 5.1 Deterministic compilation graph
- 5.2 Single-threaded scheduler with handler registry (DR-0
  log guarantee)
- 5.3 Atomic swap with invariant guards (S1 + S2 + S3)
- 5.4 Profile chain inclusion DR-4
- 5.5 Pointer to Paper 2 for an empirical instantiation

---

## 6. Methodology

Subsections :
- 6.1 Hypotheses H1-H4 (OSF pre-registration DOI cited).
  H1-H4 mapped to canonical axiom IDs : H1 → DR-1 (episodic
  conservation reduces forgetting), H2 → DR-4 (P_max ⊆ P_equ
  equivalence at the boundary), H3 → DR-2 (compositionality
  monotonicity), H4 → K1 (budget compliance).
- 6.2 Statistical tests : Welch (H1), TOST (H2), Jonckheere (H3),
  one-sample t (H4) ; Bonferroni α = 0.0125
- 6.3 Benchmark : mega-v2 (498K examples, 25 domains, stratified
  500-item retained set with SHA-256 integrity ;
  `is_synthetic=true` flag set by the adapter when the real
  mega-v2 path is unavailable, so downstream tooling can filter
  registered run_ids by source). Cycle 1 reports use the
  synthetic placeholder run_id
  `syn_s15_3_g4_synthetic_pipeline_v1` ; the dump under
  `docs/milestones/ablation-results.json` records the source as
  `synthetic-placeholder`.
- 6.4 RSA fMRI : Studyforrest (Branch A locked G1, FreeSurfer
  parcellation STG/IFG/AG ; cycle 1 reports infrastructure
  validation only — synthetic placeholder, real RSA deferred to
  cycle 2 with a freshly registered run_id)
- 6.5 Reproducibility : R1 contract (deterministic run_id), Zenodo
  DOI artifact pinning

---

## 7. Results (synthetic placeholder, G2/G4 pilot)

→ `results-section.md` (S18.2 draft)

Every empirical entry below cites the registered run_id from
`harness.storage.run_registry.RunRegistry` and the dump file
under `docs/milestones/`. Synthetic placeholders are explicitly
flagged with `(synthetic placeholder, G2 pilot)` /
`(synthetic placeholder, G4 pilot)` per project guidance.

Subsections :
- 7.1 P_min viability (G2, run_id `syn_g2_pmin_pipeline_v1`,
  dump `docs/milestones/g2-pmin-report.md`)
- 7.2 P_equ functional ablation (G4, run_id
  `syn_s15_3_g4_synthetic_pipeline_v1`, dump
  `docs/milestones/ablation-results.json`)
- 7.3 H1 forgetting reduction (synthetic placeholder, G4 pilot)
- 7.4 H3 monotonic representational alignment (synthetic
  placeholder, G4 pilot)
- 7.5 H4 energy budget compliance (synthetic placeholder, G4
  pilot)
- 7.6 H2 P_max equivalence (cycle 2 deferred, partial smoke
  test)

---

## 8. Discussion

Subsections :
- 8.1 Theoretical contribution : first executable formal framework
  for dream-based consolidation. Each claim cites the relevant
  axiom IDs (DR-0..DR-4) and invariant IDs (I1, I2, S1, S2, S3,
  K1) from `docs/invariants/registry.md` and the spec sections
  in `docs/specs/2026-04-17-dreamofkiki-framework-C-design.md`.
- 8.2 Empirical contribution : pipeline-validation evidence
  (synthetic placeholder, G2/G4 pilot ; real-data evidence
  reported in Paper 2 via the matching DR-1/DR-2/DR-4 axiom
  references and registered run_ids)
- 8.3 Limitations : synthetic-data caveats, single-substrate
  validation cycle 1, P_max skeleton only
- 8.4 Comparison with prior art (van de Ven, EWC, etc.)

## 9. Future Work — Cycle 2

Subsections :
- 9.1 E-SNN substrate (Loihi-2 thalamocortical, deferred from
  cycle 1 SCOPE-DOWN)
- 9.2 P_max full wiring + α-stream + ATTENTION_PRIOR canal-4
- 9.3 Real fMRI lab partnership (T-Col reviewer outreach S3-S5)
- 9.4 Multi-substrate Conformance Criterion validation
