"""Unit tests for the real concurrent dream worker (C2.17).

Exercises the `threaded=True` mode of `ConcurrentDreamWorker` —
a single background worker thread consumes submissions FIFO
through a bounded `queue.Queue`. The mode is additive : the
pre-existing `sync_drain=True` and `sync_drain=False` code paths
are covered by `tests/unit/test_concurrent_worker.py` and must
remain unchanged.

Invariants exercised :
  * DR-0 : every `runtime.execute(...)` call appends exactly one
    `EpisodeLogEntry`. Preserved here because the worker thread
    is the sole consumer (FIFO → ordering preserved).
  * K-QUEUE : `pending_count <= queue_size`. Bounded queue
    semantics enforce this.

  * docs/specs/2026-04-17-dreamofkiki-framework-C-design.md §7
